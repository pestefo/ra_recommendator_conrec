# Data - Tag Extensions	



Scenarios A, B, C and D are defined by the use (or not) of tag extensions. Tag extensions are tags identified in title and body of questions that may have not been specified when entering the relevant tags of a question (entered manually by the question's author).

That's why we define *Q+* and *U+*. Each question has a certain set of tags manually entered by its author, we denote it as *Q*. Once we identify the tags in the title and body of the question, we define the extension of that set as *Q+*. This set contains both Q plus the identified tags. 
Users also are described by a list of tags. This relationship is performed by the ROS Answers' engine and we denote it as *U*. In this set there are the tags of the questions in which the user has participated. We, hence, defined *U+* as the *set of extended tags of the questions* in which the user has participated.
